Heart Disease Symptom Classification Application Project applying Binary Tree as Data Structure and Using Manual Decision tree as Algorithm.

heart disease.csv is the dataset used in this project, it has 13 input features and 1 output feature in the ‘target’ column. i took 5 features namely cp, thal, age, oldpeak, and exang to do the diagnosis process. the output in this project is the ‘target’ column which diagnoses 1 (found symptoms of heart disease) or 0 (no indication of heart disease).

The display of this project I use streamlit, in streamlit users can input according to their conditions then after completion streamlit will issue diagnostic results, the results of these indications are in accordance with the features that have been set (can be seen in the tree.csv file).
